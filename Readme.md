# Custom Vector Store

Welcome to the Custom Vector Store project! This repository contains a Python implementation of a custom vector store, designed to efficiently handle and manipulate vector data.

## Features

- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized for storing large volumes of vector data.
- **Custom Operations**: Supports a variety of vector operations such as addition, subtraction, and dot product.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with your data needs.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integrating with other projects.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Custom Vector Store:

```python
from vector_store import VectorStore

# Initialize the vector store
store = VectorStore()

# Add vectors
store.add_vector([1, 2, 3])
store.add_vector([4, 5, 6])

# Perform operations
result = store.add_vectors(0, 1)
print(result)  # Output: [5, 7, 9]
```
